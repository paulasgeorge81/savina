Savina
======

Savina is an Actor Benchmark Suite.

## Brief Description

This work is an extension of the Savina Actor Model Benchmark suite. The goal is to evaluate and compare energy consumption and resource utilisation of concurrent systems, particulary the actor models in Erlang and Scala.

We re-implemented some of the selected benchmarks from the original benchmark suite in Erlang and integrated energy measurement scripts using powermetrics on macOS. Benchmarks include Ping Pong, Thread Ring, Producer-Consumer, Fork Join, Dining Philosophers, and more.
